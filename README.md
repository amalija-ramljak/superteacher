## Gameplay
Vaguely resembling (and inspired by) Monopoly and Ludo.

A player moves field by field - almost every field opens a question. If it is answered correctly, the player moves forward. If incorrectly, the player remains in place and receives a new question.

There are also special fields which provide the player with either a bonus or a setback, chosen at random from a pool of situations - they represent a school situation tied to the area (level) and each situation either moves the player forward 1-3 steps or moves them backward 1-3 steps, depending on the severity.
